# Project Title

Train Scheduler 


In this assignment, we were required to incorporate Firebase to host Trains arrival and departure data. We use Moment.js to retrieve and manipulate this information.

## Getting Started

instructions: 


You can enter new train information below the Current Train Schedule, in the Add New Train Information card. Once you enter the information and submit, it will add the new train to the Current Train Schedule.

This project is using Firebase to store the train name, frequency and start time.

Moment.js will pull the data from Firebase and manipulate it to give the next train arrival time (min).
